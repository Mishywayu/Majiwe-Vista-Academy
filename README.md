Here is an overview of the steps taken to build this school website, from design to development.

# Design Phase
The designed phase was done by an amazing designer, and she use Figma.

Here is what she did:
### Research and Planning: 
Started with researching similar school websites for inspiration and understanding user needs.
### Wireframing: 
Created wireframes using tool Figma to map out the layout and structure of the website.
### Design Mockups: 
Designed mockups based on wireframes to visualize the look and feel of the website.


# Development Phase
### Technology Selection: 
I chose React.js for its component-based architecture, which facilitates reusability and makes managing complex UIs easier.
### Styling Approach: 
Initially utilized vanilla CSS for simplicity and control over styles. However, considering the scalability and rapid development, Tailwind CSS seems like a more preferable choice.
### Component Development: 
Developed individual components for different sections of the website such as header, footer, navigation, etc.
### Integration: 
Integrated the designed mockups with React components, ensuring consistency in design and functionality.
### Testing: 
Conducted testing across various devices and browsers to ensure compatibility and functionality.
(ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜‚This is why I regret using Vanilla CSS, should have used Tailwind CSS)
### Deployment: 
Deployed the website to netlify, ensuring it's accessible to the intended audience.

 
# Future Work
### Responsiveness: 
I acknowledge the need for improving responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes. This includes optimizing layouts, font sizes, and image scaling for better user experience.
### Enhanced Interactivity: 
Implementing more interactive features such as dynamic forms, real-time notifications, etc., to enhance user engagement.
### Accessibility: 
Ensuring the website complies with accessibility standards to cater to users with disabilities.
### Performance Optimization: 
Optimizing the website's performance by minimizing load times, reducing unnecessary requests, and optimizing assets.
### Continuous Iteration: 
Emphasize the importance of continuously iterating and improving the website based on user feedback and emerging technologies.
# Conclusion
Building the school website involved a combination of design thinking, technical expertise, and continuous refinement. While React.js and vanilla CSS were initially chosen for their familiarity and flexibility, there's a clear recognition of the benefits of transitioning to Tailwind CSS for streamlined styling. The journey doesn't end with the initial development; it's an ongoing process of evolution and improvement to deliver the best possible experience to users. 
There is a lot I need to cover in development. Software Development is a learning journey and I am in for it!
