            I began my career in a classroom 30 years ago, as a class teacher.
            My passion for teaching and learning has guided me over these many
            years to reach greater heights in this work that I love very much. I
            have worked as a Principal for 10 years, including my last 5 years
            as a Founding Prinicpal of Merishaw Boy Academy.

            Having completed my Masters Degree in Education and Post-graduate
            studies in Social Sciences, where I studied Cultural Diversity and
            Islam in the West, I find myself at home here in this thriving
            school community that is - Majiwe Vista Academy (MVA)
            <br />
            <br />
            Our goal at MVA is to witness the joy of learning every single day
            at our school. This is supported by trusting out teachers, giving
            them the autonomy to craft leassons based on the Kenyan curricula
            that they see is best for our students. This practice bonds us and
            nurtured joy of learning that is meaningful and purposeful for out
            children in this vibrant learning community.
