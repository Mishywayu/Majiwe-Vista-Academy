          <p>
            The junior school curriculum at Majiwe Vista Academy is thoughtfully
            designed to provide a well-rounded and comprehensive educational
            experience for our young learners. Anchored in a holistic approach,
            our curriculum focuses on developing foundational skills across
            various subjects, fostering critical thinking, and promoting a love
            for learning. In English language arts, students engage in language
            development, reading comprehension, and creative writing activities.
            Mathematics instruction is structured to build a strong numerical
            foundation, emphasizing problem-solving and logical reasoning. The
            sciences are introduced through hands-on experiments and
            exploration, while social studies cover a broad range of topics to
            cultivate global awareness . . . .
